### Built with ChatGPT and Three.js.

You can access a live version at https://mitch7w.github.io/Sam-Altman-Board-Runner-Game-ChatGPT-Generated/

This was built using ChatGPT 3.5 with minimal coding input, rather preferring to prompt ChatGPT to solve errors and come up with solutions to make the game work nicely. I've never worked with Three.js or game development before but I only had to code about 10% of the game and fix some weird canvas/html bugs - the rest was all ChatGPT. It's a messy codebase and not at all streamlined but hey, this is a finished game after just a few hours of work.

The entire history of prompts used to build the game can be found at https://chat.openai.com/share/743619d5-0079-44dc-aa76-2fcb34a2ede9
